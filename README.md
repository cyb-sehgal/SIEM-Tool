# SIEM Tool with Elasticsearch and Kibana
## Overview :
I developed a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool using a combination of powerful open-source technologies: Elasticsearch, Kibana, Metricbeat, and Filebeat. This tool is aimed at enhancing cybersecurity for personal projects and provides a robust platform for monitoring and analyzing security events.

## Why This Project?
My interest in cybersecurity was further fueled by completing the Google Cyber Security Professional Certificate. This project became an exciting endeavor to apply my knowledge practically. Additionally, the open-source nature of these tools makes the project cost-effective and scalable. Many leading organizations such as Adobe, Audi, Lenovo, and Walmart Technology rely on the Elasticstack platform for their cybersecurity needs.

# Technologies Used :
## Elasticsearch:
A distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine, used here to store and index security event data. It allows for fast and flexible querying.
## Kibana : 
A powerful visualization tool that complements Elasticsearch. It provides a user-friendly interface to explore, visualize, and analyze the data stored in Elasticsearch.
## Metricbeat and Filebeat :
These lightweight agents are used for collecting and shipping various types of data to Elasticsearch. Metricbeat gathers metrics from the operating system and services running on the server, while Filebeat is used for log data collection.
## Ubuntu 22.04.3 :
The chosen operating system for its stability, security features, and compatibility with the Elasticsearch stack.
## VMware :
The virtualization platform that provides a flexible and isolated environment for running the SIEM tool.
